# YouTube Ad Skipper

This is a Mozilla Firefox Add-On Accelerating and Skipping YouTube Ads in Less Than a Second.

* **Real-time Acceleration**: Ads are sped up on the fly.
* **Auto-Skip**: Bypass ads as soon as they become skippable.

#### How it Works

A process, running when the current tab is `youtube.com/watch`, periodically checks the page content for ads. If there
is one, the process accelerates it by setting the playback rate to 1000. As soon as the `Skip Ads ->` button
shows up, the process clicks it. When the ad is skipped, the process increments a local private counter of skipped ads
in the browser.

#### Privacy and Security

* It does not make any other changes to the page.
* It does not collect any data.
* It does not store or retrieve any cookies.
* It stores the number of ads skipped in the local storage, which can only be read by the browser
  (this information is not accessible to anyone / anything else).

#### Demo

Note: Some ads in this demo are skipped so fast that it's difficult to notice them.
